# theorem 2 benefits edge detection and theorem 1 benefits resolution.

- **Theorem 2 → edge detection and regime switching.**
    - It gives you a test on the coefficient “radius budget” that tells you where there are true jumps, so it is ideal for edge detection, transient detection, and deciding *where* to switch algorithms or modes.[^1][^2]
- **Theorem 1 → resolution, budgeting, and quality metrics.**
    - It tells you how the remaining error is distributed as you increase resolution and where extra resolution is being wasted, so it guides *how far* to push global resolution and how to define meaningful quality / error budgets (edge vs smooth).[^3][^4][^5]
